                <p class="left">Anyone could very easily mistake my grandfather to be someone intimidating, but that is not how I know him. To me, he is Pa. To me, he is the farthest person from intimidating. I’m sure being his only granddaughter has some effect on that. With that being said, I can definitely understand where the mistake comes from. You will almost always catch my grandfather lounging with a cigar and a big pair of sunglasses. Not to mention that he has an extremely italian name.</p>

                    <p class="right">Pa left for the navy in his early 20s, joining Vietnam on the USS Hale. He spent almost 3 years on the World Cruise in 1957. I have heard countless stories, and seen imagery of the ships and my grandfather dressed in uniform.<br><br>Stories of the places he experienced have stuck with me the most. Whether that means countries he visited or the bunks he had to stay in. I learned a lot about the world growing up and hearing these stories. Even now, he trusted me to keep his dog tags safe as a reminder of the things he told me.</p>

                    <p class="blurbtext">I asked Pa to go out for a ride in the Monte Carlo. We took it out and went for a joy ride while I filmed. The car turned heads all around town.</p>

                <p class="right">Pa’s Monte Carlo has been with him for about 40 years now. It’s a 1973 Sport Coupe Monte Carlo, still running and in near perfect condition. He takes pride in the fact that all its parts are originals. The only unoriginal part of the car is the color, custom for him when he wanted something lighter. The car is his prized possession, especially being one of under 5,000 of its model ever manufactured.<br><br>The Monte Carlo has been apart of a lot of history in our family. When my own mom and aunts were growing up, it was one of two cars Pa and Gramma shared. The stories continued to grow, like the time my mom got in an accident and was more worried about the car than herself. Now, with myself and my cousins, we all have memories of the car. We’re in awe of it, and my cousins always want to get behind the wheel. The only one Pa cannot get behind the wheel is me. The last thing I want to be is the one who ruins it.</p>

                <p class="left">My family has always been extremely close knit on my mother’s side. I attribute a lot of that to my grandfather. Without Pa, I do not think my family would be as close as we are. He and Gramma raised us to enjoy our time together, and even created most of the traditions we still experience today. <br><br>Pa has always been one to make the most of time together, whether that be sharing old stories or just joking around. His personality has always been one of my favorites, and he is the one to always know the right thing to say. He knows how to cheer you up and he also knows how to prove a point.</p>

He has had the biggest influence on me growing up, and I have no idea what I would have done without him. He always used to make this one joke, “Would you want to trade me in for a better Pa?” and my answer has always been, and will always be, “No.”</p>
